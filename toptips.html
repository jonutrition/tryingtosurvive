  <h1>Top Tips for Freshers Week</h1>

  <h2>Worried about friends, first food shop, or finances?</h2>

  <h3>Look no further, as we're here to give you the best advice on how to properly do freshers!!!</h3>
  <ol>
  <p>
  <li>Get a student overdraft set up, in case your loan doesn't stretch.</li>
  </p>

  <p>
  <li>Make sure you hit up Freshers fair, all the best freebies are there.</li>
  </p>

  <p>
    <li>Don't be afraid to chat to people, everyone is in the same situation! (They're likely feeling a little lost too.)</li>
  </p>

  <p>
    <li>If you don't like your flatmates, get to know people on your course. Lots of people don't find their friendship group within their flat.</li>
  </p>

  <p>
    <li>Check your Hallam gmail account regularly: from library and referencing guides, to welfare and wellbeing support, all info goes direct to your student email.</li>
  </p>

  <p>
    <li>Ring home every so often, and don't forget about your home friends!</li>
  </p>

  <p>
    <li>Clubs and societies are your friend ... but don't get drawn in to the Christian Society, as you're signing yourself up for a year's worth of Saturday coffee mornings ;) </li>
  </p>

  <p>
    <li>Sweeten up the local Tesco employees and reap the rewards when you bag all the best reduced items on an evening!</li>
  </p>

  <p>
    <li>Download a ticket swapping app, so if you ever buy a ticket to an event you can't make, another person can buy your ticket off you:)</li>
  </p>

  <p>
    <li>Put your phone in another room when you're studying so as not to get too distracted, trust that this is the downfall of so many initially-motivated students!</li>
